Good or bad, I find ways to enhance my understanding of myself, my surroundings and of people. Later on in life, I learned to channel this and found myself in a leadership role in a company that works for people and with people in distress, and here I found something that felt right. A role that was ever-changing and evolving, a role where you get challenged every day and foremost get to learn stuff and at the same time get to support and help your colleagues in their respective quests.

They were about HTML, and even one post was about the then just invented language Javascript. I was about 12 or 13 and the Internet had started to gain mainstream momentum. The dot-com bubble was building up. It would burst in March 2000, and I would give up on programming long before that, I just didn't know that while writing those posts.</p><p>It felt like I had to wait a million years to get computer access at home. To stand the waiting, I started collecting computer magazines, bringing the attached floppies and later CD-ROM's over to friends with computers to see what they contained. These magazines also used to provide simple guides on various topics, one of those happened to be HTML. I had to memorize the tags so that I could test them out by entering them in notepad.exe on the demo systems at my local Lap Power dealership.</p><p>I was 11 when I got my hands on a screaming fast multi media monster (Pentium MMX) at home, a year later, a Telia 020 dialup connection completed the setup. It gave me everything I ever wished for. At this point, I knew very well how to abuse the <marquee> HTML tag and quickly managed to set up Geocities hosting.</marquee></p><p>The Internet was very different back then. It provided me with a safe space during my years in secondary school. I even OP'd a successful channel on DALnet during those years.

I wanted to, but my interest had already started to shift to movie making.</p><p>In my later teens, I tried my best preparing for a career in film making. It proved to be difficult, being based in a small town far away from the industry didn't exactly help. To me, it made little sense to move just to Stockholm. If relocation was going to be required, why not move even further away. That's how I ended up in the Netherlands and how I began my exploration of north-west Europe. Brussels, Belgium was to follow, and before finally ending up in Stockholm, I spent ten years in Hamburg, Germany.</p><p>I think it was in the Netherlands that I got my first VPS, I was a bit afraid at first, as it didn't come with a full-blown desktop environment that I had come to expect from my time using Red Hat Linux 5.2 (not REHL, much older).

One thing bothered me, though, while I was confident in configure and run applications, I could still not fully understand how something was working by reading its source code.</p><p>After doing Sysadmin, I developed a passion for programming. I remember, for years, all I did was study programming. I lived and breathed programming.

As a schoolboy, I read all the books in my local library about the technical details of steam engines, airplanes, rockets, robots, and more. When I was in 6th grade, I discovered a missing component. It was a computer. I immediately realized how valuable computers can be in my passion for invention. </p><p>I decided to learn as much as possible about computers and programming.Thanks to my parents, they very soon noticed my craving for computers.

All my friends were heavily into playing computer games at that time, but since I proved to be a pretty crappy gamer, I started to explore programming instead, and have not stopped since.</p><p>I immediately fell in love with the way I could be creative and playful, learn things and challenge myself at the same time. Pretty quickly I got involved in the so-called demo scene (a sub culture for showing off your artistic and programming skills) and started to create so-called computer demos with my team, competing against others teams at demo parties. Our team consisted of people from all over Sweden, and even other countries. In retrospect I realise that, as young teenagers we were working on projects together in self-organising distributed teams. We were using the ways of remote communication available at the time, which was the telephone, letters with floppies and sometimes modems. All of this gave me some really valuable lessons that proved to be essential throughout my work life. What happened to the demo scene and the team? Well, we are still doing things together, on Commodore 64, Amiga and other retro platforms, going to demo parties and competing with other teams.</p><p>Working with software engineering gives me a perfect mix of creativity and structure. The feeling when you create something of value with your team, or solve a complex problem together is awesome. I believe strongly in the ability of people working together in a playful manner, to make bits and bytes come to life. It gives me a great feeling when I see people helping each other out and learning together.
